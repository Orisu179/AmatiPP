Amati++
============

Based off of the original [Amati Project](https://github.com/glocq/Amati) by [Gr√©goire Locqueville](https://github.com/glocq), this project builds on top of it
and will have more features. 
This project uses the [pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template as a starting point.

Building
--------
- To build, make sure that libfaust is installed from [here](https://faust.grame.fr/downloads/), and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) is installed.

- Next, populate the sub repositories with ``git submodule update --init``

- Open the project in Clion or VS2022 and build the standalone version, otherwise run the following in order:
  -   ``mkdir build``
  -   ``cd build``
  -   ``cmake ..``
  -   ``cmake --build``


More details will be added as the project gets developed.
