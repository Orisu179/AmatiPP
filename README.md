Amati++
============

Based off of the original [Amati Project](https://github.com/glocq/Amati) by [Gr√©goire Locqueville](https://github.com/glocq), this project builds on top of it
and will have more features. 
This project uses the [pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template as a starting point.

Building
--------
To build, make sure that libfaust is installed from [here](https://faust.grame.fr/downloads/).


More details will be added as the project gets developed.
